## My assumption from the requirement

• **No same employee can work in 2 cafes:** If a userId is assigned to cafe that user can't be assigned to another cafe. <br/>
• **Calculate number of days worked:** The day a user is assigned to a cafe is the Start date.

###### The DB is up on Mongodb cloud.
